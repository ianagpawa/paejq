Documentation Notes

Overall, the documentation is well-written, easy to follow, and contains good examples.  There were only a few places that I encountered issues.  The first was styling the button.  The documentation indicated that I could use a stylesheet to customize the button, but I had difficulty with it, so I opted to use the customCSS property instead. I may have misunderstood the section, so I would liked some more clarification in that section. Additionally, I would have liked for the sections regarding the styling of the button to have been consolidated into one continuous section rather than in two sections that were far apart.  The other issue I encountered was with creating a cart using the `cartCreate` method.  I got a reference error indicating `cartCreate` was undefined, so I resorted to calling the cart API endpoint.  I would have liked to have seen an example of the `cartCreate` being implemented.
